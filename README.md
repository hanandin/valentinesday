Valentine's Day React App


This playful Valentine's Day web app built with React offers a fun way to ask someone to be your Valentine. When presented with the question "Will you be my Valentine?" and two response options, the "No" button amusingly dodges the cursor, moving to a random location on the screen every time the user tries to click it. If the user clicks "Yes," the buttons disappear, a new message of affection appears, and the image changes to reflect the positive response.

Features


- A "No" button that moves randomly on the screen when hovered over to avoid being clicked.


- A "Yes" button that, when clicked, changes the GIF displayed and reveals a sweet follow-up message.


- Responsive design for different screen sizes.


Usage
Simply open the app and you will be greeted with the question "Will you be my Valentine?". Try to click "No" or "Yes" and see what happens!
